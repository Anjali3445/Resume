        Love Babbar was born and brought up in a middle-class family. He completed his schooling from Andhra Education Society School, Delhi with 95% in class 12th. During his class 11th, he used to take home tuitions for 1000 rupees per month. Thereafter he completed his engineering degree from the Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi.
        Since his childhood, Love Babbar was highly inspired by leaders like Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Maharana Pratap. And that's when he decided to add the terms revolution, self-esteem, pride, and courage in the book of his life. He always has a deep desire to serve the country and joining an Indian Army seems the right opportunity for him. So he decided to apply for the NDA (National Defence Academy) Exam and Army TES (Technical Entry Scheme) to join the Indian army. Love Babbar missed out on the NDA exam with just 2 marks. During his 2nd semester of college, he also applied for TES and successfully cleared the SSB interview and made it to a final merit list but declared medically unfit due to some reason. He got disheartened but didn't lose hope.
